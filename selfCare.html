<h3 class="selfcareinfo1" align="center"> Self care is taking care of and honoring your body, mind, and spirit in a way that activates your best self.
Self-care choices are those that improve your physical, mental, or emotional health, and move you towards your desired outcome.
Self-care choices move you forward and succeed. </h3>

<p><h3 class= "selfcareinfo2" align="center"> What “moving forward” means is something only you can determine based on your desired outcomes, and what you need on each particular day. For example, getting a kind-sweethearted message may be a form of self-care that moves someone forward on a given day,
Where as doing a challenging training session may be the self-care that moves them forward on a different day.
</h3></p>
<span class="push"> Then ill push you another day, making you move forward!! </span>

<p><h3 class="selfcareinfo3" align="center"> Contrary to what is often shown on social media, self-care is almost always less glamorous than bubble baths, massages, and pedicures. Something that is often misleading about many of the self-care posts on social media is that true self-care choices aren’t typically the easiest choices.
Self-comfort is a type of behavior that is focused on soothing and coping rather than moving us toward our desired goals and direction.</h3></p>

<p><h3 class= "selfcareinfo4" align="center"> Having another glass of wine when you decided you would only have one,  etc.
Chosen often enough, self-comfort will keep you right where you are, as opposed to moving forward towards your desired outcome which is the right weay of life. </h3></p>

  Self-care needs to be something you actively plan, rather than something that just happens.
  It is an active choice and you must treat it as such. Add certain activities to your calendar, announce your plans to others in order to increase your commitment, and actively look for opportunities to practice self-care. </h4>

<h4 class="selfcarerule" align ="center">
  What is often emphasize is that keeping a conscious mind is what counts.
   Be aware of what you do, why you do it, how it feels, and what the outcomes are. </h4>
