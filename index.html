<p class="p1"> SASC is a website meant to endorse jokes and sarcasm when refering to serious topics, for this instance: self care.
  Self care can be many things, for example hygiene, diets, exercise, therapy, etc. which is part of the reason why you shouldnt take
  it seriously. Lets say you and your friend's version of self care is completely different. Your friend may think taking a cheat day
  during a diet is self care because it allows you to grow off of indulgances and become a more positive person. While you might think
  that pushing yourself to not take the risk of cheating on a diet and causing yourself to fall back into unhealthy life choices is the
  epitome of growing off your indulgances. Because of human diversity self care has become many things, so we decided to split it up
  into 2 categories: physical (Self Image) and mental (Self Care).</p>

  <p class="p2"> After learning about the physical and mental image of self care, you may wonder how there is sarcasm and jokes
  involved. SASC actually stands for <em> Self Aware </em> Self Care, meaning that throughout the webpages there are little
  instances of you getting replies from the computer whether it be sarcastic, funny, nice, etc. Each page has it's own
  personality and style. In itself the "self awareness" is its own game or interactive activity. It can hide in something as
  small as the title or as big as the quote generator. Its your choice to find them, or maybe not; just know that everything
  here is for fun and shouldnt be taken seriously. Ex <span class="ex"> dont try to find me, its just a waste of time </span></p>
